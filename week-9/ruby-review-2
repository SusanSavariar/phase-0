# Reverse Words


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Lucs].
# This challenge took me [] hours.

# Pseudocode
# Define a method that takes a sentence
# Split the sentence into an array by each space
# Reverse each word in the array
# Join the array with a space between each entry and return



# Initial Solution

def reverse_words (sentence)
  sentence=sentence.split(" ")
  sentence.each do |word|
  word.reverse!
  end
  sentence=sentence.join(" ")
end

puts reverse_words("Have a nice day!")
