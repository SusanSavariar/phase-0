# Die Class 1: Numeric

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ]

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# 0. Pseudocode

# Input: The number of sides of a die
# Output: Number of sides of a die
# Steps:
# Check that there is at least 1 side to the dice, if less than 1 side, give an error message.
#I am stuck here. I struggled with this challenge and in the interest of time am moving on.

# 1. Initial Solution

class Die
  def initialize(sides)
    # code goes here
  end

  def sides
    # code goes here
  end

  def roll
    # code goes here
  end
end



# 3. Refactored Solution







# 4. Reflection
What is an ArgumentError and why would you use one?

# An ArgumentError is an error message that is given when one of the arguments provided is invalid.

# What new Ruby methods did you implement? What challenges and successes did you have in implementing them?
#

# What is a Ruby class?
# A class is a blue print for individual objects.

# Why would you use a Ruby class?
# Writing code would be easier by having a blueprint of objects pre-written.

# What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?
# A local variable is only usable within the block of code it lives in
# An instance variable is visible anywhere there is an instance of the class where the variable was defined.

# Where can an instance variable be used?
# An instance variable can be used anywhere within the instance of its class.
