What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
-The primary goal for my site is for informative purposes. It will serve as an introduction to me, my background, professional history, how to contact me, and links to my social profile.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
-My target audience is probably future employers or maybe people who just want to get to know me better. To address employers, I have a link to my portfolio which would include my resume and various projects that I have done. There is a general about me section for anyone who would like a quick background on me.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
-I would ideally like them to start with the about me section just to get a quick overview of what I would like them to know before they poke around my portfolio. I would like for employers to view my portfolio and then contact me.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
-It is important for a developer to understand design to better understand designers on the project and work cohesively together.Understanding design helps you to recognize patterns design consise and consistant code.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
-User experience design is valuable because it is easy for a developer to focus on the technical aspects of developement and forget that there are real problems to solve. Learning and understanding design helps to be aware of the challanges a user might face and help find a solution to any problems they may face with user flow.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
-The parts I find challenging are still command line/git related. I get stuck on how to push my site or itegrate my file into the command line. I know what my goal is but I seem to get stuck on these little things that frustrate me.
