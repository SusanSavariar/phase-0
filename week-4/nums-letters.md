What does puts do?
  -Puts will print the output of whatever it's puts'ing onto the console, but will return nil.
What is an integer? What is a float?
  - An integer is a number that does not have any value besides zero after the decimal point. A float does have values besides and including zero after the decimal point.
What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
  -Float division is appropriate when exact precision is necessary or if something needs to be divided in a realistic manner. For example, you can't see 4.5 movies.
  -Integer division works best when exact precision is not necessary. For example, 7/2 using float division would get you 3.5 but in using integer division you will round down. So 7/2 would be 3.

Reflection
How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
  -By using symbols, variables, and strings.
What is the difference between integers and floats?
  -An integer is a whole number with no values besides zero after the decimal. Floats may include values other than and including zero after the decimal point.
What is the difference between integer and float division?
  --Float division is appropriate when exact precision is necessary or if something needs to be divided in a realistic manner. For example, you can't see 4.5 movies.
  -Integer division works best when exact precision is not necessary. For example, 7/2 using float division would get you 3.5 but in using integer division you will round down. So 7/2 would be 3.
What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
  -Strings are characters enclosed in quotations.Strings convey messages that numbers do not.
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
  -Local variables live and work inside of methods. You would use them when you need to define a variable in a method and when you don't want that variable to be getting out into the larger code and mess up anything. Local variables keep things organized in large projects that contain many variables.
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
  -This was my first introduction to ruby (other than interview prep). I liked it so far. I like that it is logical and straightforward. I definitely like it much better than CSS.
