1.1 Think about Time
Time management is the process of exercising conscious control over the amount of time spent on various activities. We learned different methods of productivity like "time boxing", the "fogg method" and how to make your behavior into healthy habits.

Time boxing is when a group or individual sets a previously agreed upon period of time towards the completion of a goal. Work must be stopped when the time limit is reached and the work must be evaluated. Rather than working until the goal is achieved.

I manage my time very efficiently. I have always considered myself a very disciplined person. I set specific goals (like the Fogg method indicates) about what I need to finish or accomplish every day. I follow a routine so my behavior becomes a habit. My schedule is second nature to me because now it is a habit. My currently strategy is working for the most part but I get frustrated easily when something doesn't work for me. I can stare at a problem for hours instead of moving on and not wasting time.

I plan on utilizing the Pomodoro method to improve my productivity. Sometimes a break is just what you need to prevent mental fatigue and improve clarity.

My plan is to continue what I have been doing and follow a set schedule so I accomplish completing my modules for the day/week. I plan on incorporating meditation into my routine so I can increase my productivity and focus without anxiety.

1.2 The Command Line
A shell is a macroprocessor that executes commands. It provides an interface into an operating system. Bash is a specific type of command line shell. Bash in the default shell in Mac OSX and Linux.

The most challenging thing for me is to troubleshoot when I encounter an error in my terminal. For example when I tried to make a temp directory it kept telling me no such file exists. I played around with it and it eventually worked. I am finding that I lack patience to troubleshoot sometimes.

I successfully made it through all of the commands.

I feel like they are all important commands. They are very basic but each command is important. Making/removing/ and moving directories all probably the most important.

pwd- print working directory

ls- list directory

mv- move directory

cd- change directory

../ calling something in the working directory

touch- makes empty file in unix

mkdir- make directory

less- view a file in unix

rmdir- remove directory

rm- remove file

help- looks through help files and finds something potentially relevant help for you

1.4 Forking and Cloning
1. log onto your github, click the + next to your name and click new repository.

2. Name your repository, set it public or private if you choose and add a license if you wish. Then click create repository.

3.To fork a repository, click the fork button next to the repository you want to copy. Select your profile and save it as a fork on your profile.

4. To clone to your computer, copy the HTTPS url link at the bottom right hand corner

5. Mkdir (make a directory) to clone into. Type git clone and paste the URL copied from github. You may be prompted to enter github username and password. Hit enter and you should be good to go.

6. Go into the file and click ls just to see if all of the files have come through.

Forking is advantageous because now when you make changes or additions you will be affecting your own repository versus the main repository on the original page.

Challenges:

I watched the video twice and had to read  the instructions a couple of times before I understood what was going on. Once I started the process in my terminal though it was pretty straight forward. I think I copied it correctly but when I hit ls after I made the git clone the same file names that came up in the video didn't come up for me. I followed the steps exactly so I'm not sure if what I'm seeing is correct or not. Or maybe I just don't know where to look?
