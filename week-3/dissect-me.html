<p>For this assignment we were instructed to choose a topic to research and then write about it. I chose to research the difference between margin, border, and padding.</p>

<p>Basically the padding is what exists between the content of a block and the border, the margin is what exists between the border and the edge of the block, and the border is what is in the middle. All three of these things can be non-existent, or they can have a thickness which can be specified using two different methods. Borders and padding can have a background, but the margin is transparent and will show whatever background it overlaps.</p>

<p>You can specify margin or padding on each side of the block individually, or all on one line as shown in the examples below. When the margin or padding is specified all on one line, the first number is the top and then rotates clockwise to right, bottom, and left.</p>

1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  -We've started every HTML document with <!DOCTYPE html> tag. I use the <head> and <body> tags to define metacontent and actual content written on the page. I think the <nav> tag is useful for organizing the navigation links in the document. I don't use it often but it now that I know how to use it, I will use it more often.

2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  The header is at the top of the page. It contains the heading/logo and describes what the web site is.
  The Body holds the main content of the page. It contains pictures, links, and text.
  A footer that goes across the bottom of the site and contains  information such as a legal disclaimer and contact details.

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  I did not actually know anything about the tab triggers. I thought it was a really cool functionality of Sublime. I'll definitly save snippets in the future. It seems like such a time saver.
