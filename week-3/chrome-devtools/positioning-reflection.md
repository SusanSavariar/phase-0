1. How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
  -Using DevTools allows you to format and position elements in the browser. Devtools allows you to fix layout issues and optimize code in real time.

2. How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
  -You can resize elements by changing the pixel/EM/percentage attributes within the body section for the different divs.

3. What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
  -Absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning are all positioned elements.
  -A relatively positioned element is an element whose position is relative to the objects around it.
  -An absolute positioned element is an element whose position is fixed or absolute.
  A static element uses normal behavior and is in its current position in the flow.Top, right, bottom, left indexes do not apply.

4. What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
  -Margin refers to spaces between the border and the next element. Padding goes around all four sides of the content and you can change the padding for each side with CSS. The border separates margin from padding.

5. What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
  I understand why this challenge was helpful to learn CSS however, I wish we had more guidance in the challenge. I feel like a lot of it was trial and error (fingers crossed!). I'm not really sure why some of it worked and why it didn't. But for the sake of time we had to move on if we didn't understand a release. I personally think this challenge was more to complete the challenge to move on rather than really understand the concepts fully.
